Both `Stable` and `Edge` installers come with `experimental features in Docker Engine` enabled by default and configurable on `Docker Daemon preferences` for experimental mode. We recommend that you disable experimental features for apps in production.

When you are running `Docker for Mac`, you do not need Docker Machine nodes running at all locally (or anywhere else). With Docker for Mac, you have a new, native virtualization system running (`HyperKit`) which takes the place of the `VirtualBox` system. To learn more, see `Docker for Mac` vs. `Docker Toolbox`.

What the install includes: The installation provides `Docker Engine`, `Docker CLI client`, `Docker Compose`, `Docker Machine`, and `Kitematic`.
